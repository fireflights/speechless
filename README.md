# speechless
An attempt to visualize Lady Gaga's speechlessness. From The Fame to ARTPOP. Nothing else I can say.


The main concept of this project is to try to understand or analyze how Lady Gaga's lyrics look like in a visual way.
I have thought of this idea 2 years ago, but here I am, still preoccupied by work and studying.

However, my renewed interest in keeping up with my coding skills and helping out a friend in another project (an actual art piece) made me continue this again. Plus, I finally get to make a Github page other than the original one.

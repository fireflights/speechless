Cherry, Cherry, Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom

I can't help myself I'm addicted to a life of material
It's some kind of joke, I'm obsessively opposed to the typical
All we care about is, runway models, Cadillacs and liquor bottles
Give me something I wanna be, retro glamour, Hollywood yes we live
for the

Fame
Doin' it for the
Fame
'cause we wanna live the life of the rich and famous

Fame
Doin' it for the
Fame
'cause we gotta taste for champagne and endless fortune

Fame Fame baby
The Fame Fame
We live for the Fame Fame Baby
The Fame Fame
Isn't it a shame shame baby
A shame shame
In it for The Fame Fame baby
The Fame Fame

I can see myself in the movies with my picture in city lights
Photograph my mind and whatever else you'd like to shoot
You decide
All we care about is, pornographic girls on film and body plastic
Give me something, I wanna see television and hot blondes in odd positions

Fame
Doin' it for the
Fame
'cause we wanna live the life of the rich and famous

Fame
Doin' it for the
Fame
'cause we gotta taste for champagne and endless fortune

Fame Fame baby
The Fame Fame
We live for the Fame Fame Baby
The Fame Fame
Isn't it a shame shame baby
A shame shame
In it for The Fame Fame baby
The Fame Fame

Don't ask me how or why
But I'm gonna make it happen this time
My teenage dream tonight
Yeah I'm gonna make it happen this time

Fame
Doin' it for the
Fame
'cause we wanna live the life of the rich and famous

Fame
Doin' it for the
Fame
'cause we gotta taste for champagne and endless fortune

Fame
Doin' it for the
Fame
'cause we wanna live the life of the rich and famous

Fame
Doin' it for the
Fame
'cause we gotta taste for champagne and endless fortune

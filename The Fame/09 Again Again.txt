You've gotta lotta nerve
Comin' here
When I'm still with him
And I can't have you, it isn't fair

Born, March of '86
My birthday's comin'
And if I had one wish
Yeah, you'd be it

When you're 'round
I lose myself
Inside your mouth
You've got brown eyes
Like no one else
Baby, make it to me

Again, and again
Again
Again
Again again
Never stop again and again
Again
Again
Again again
Never stop oh

He never really saw me
Or waited when we were hookin' up
Yeah, he'd never last
Last week when I was sad
You said that you knew
My eyes change from
Kind of green
To “Kind of blue”

When you're 'round
I lose myself inside your mouth
You've got brown eyes like no one else
Baby make it to me 

Again, and again
Again
Again
Again again
Never stop again and again
Again
Again
Again again
Never stop oh

They tell me if I leave him
Baby, would you be there?
'Cause maybe you could
be m-m-mine all the t-t-time
